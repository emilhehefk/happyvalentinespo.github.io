                        <p>

		It's February 14th, and I want to take this opportunity to greet you a Happy Valentine's Day! Since dati pa talaga, I still like you, and I still adore you. All of the memories that we've shared long, long ago, dae ko ito malingawan though aram ko aki pa kita ka'to, and it does not matter na 'to saimo, it's okay, I really understand.
<p>

		But I just want you to know na, I've been admiring you for almost 5 years now, dagdag pa na naging kaklase taka last year, that was the most wonderful school year of my entire life. Seeing you sa likod with your friends and watching you smiling was so relaxing, and I could stay there forever. I was thinking the entire semester to ask you if I could court you (try lang sana) pero I don't have enough courage para sabihon ta aram ko mataas standards mo and never ko 'tong maabot, so at least this time nasabi ko saimo, and you are the reason tano nag igot ako mag adal last school year cause I want you to noticed me dawa aram kong mayo ka man paki.
</p>
<p>
		Those interactions with you were the best when you asked me kung gusto ko mag paint. I truly wanted to say "Yes," but na shocked ako kaya nag "No" ako (sabay hali). I was super delulu that time na naisip ko pa na you might like me too, haha. Katong mayo kang umbrella and nag payong ka sako was the best. Anyway, the purpose of this is that I want you to know that I exist and I'm so glad and happy to see you growing. I wish you success in life, good luck. Thank you!
